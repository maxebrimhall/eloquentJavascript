/*Write a class Vec that represents a vector in two-dimensional space. It takes x and y parameters (numbers), that it saves to properties of the same name.

Give the Vec prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take another vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectors’ (this and the parameter) x and y values.

Add a getter property length to the prototype that computes the length of the vector—that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).*/
